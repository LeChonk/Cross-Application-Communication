## Requirements

###### Before we continue, there are some prerequisites.
* VS(C) - Visual Studio (Community) (IDE where you can create a plentiful amount of different types of applications) [VSC Download](https://visualstudio.microsoft.com/downloads/)
  * IDE where we'll be creating our application.
* Python - Preferrably the latest version (Python3.9) [Python3 Download](https://www.python.org/downloads/)
  * Used for our REST API which is how we'll be communicating between applications.
  
And then of course, we'll need Roblox Studio if you don't have that downloaded already.
